Then they make adjustments for the ways in which your home is different from each of the others, and then average the adjusted values. The CMA adjustments are very subjective, and there is great variation between REALTORSÂ® as to how much detail they include and the number and amount of the adjustments they make, so be sure to ask any prospective REALTORÂ® to explain their CMA in detail.`

                body: `When selling a home the more exposure the home gets, the greater the chances the property will sell quickly. However, it is not essential to place a sign in the yard or a lockbox on the door.  Sometimes sellers donât want their neighbors finding out they are selling their home so they prefer not to use a yard sign.  And some sellers are very concerned about security and donât want a lockbox on the door. If you decide not to use a yard sign and/or lockbox, be sure to communicate that to your agent before the listing agreement is signed. Your agent will make a note to this effect in the MLS listing. Of course, sellers must be aware that homes often sell to buyers driving through the neighborhood. Without a yard sign, those opportunities are lost to the seller. In addition, by not allowing a lockbox, the seller or listing agent must make themselves available every time the property is shown which may result in some potential buyers not seeing the property because schedules cannot be coordinated.`

A buyer chooses to purchase a home because they can envision themselves living in it. If you are there, even if you are outside, they feel like an intruder! Even if you just meet them at the door and graciously tell them to take their time while you walk around the block â it is still your house in their mind. The best way to handle it is to coordinate the timing with the agent showing your property and leave the house before they arrive with their buyers. If you have a pet, take them with you. One option is to just get in your car and park in a nearby parking lot and have the buyerâs agent text you when they leave.`

There are two types of these letters â one is called a âpre-approvalâ and the other is called a âpre-qualificationâ.  While, the lender will check the buyerâs credit before issuing either of these letters, a pre-approval is better than a pre-qualification. Before issuing a pre-approval the lender will generally require the buyer to provide documentation of their sources of income, but with a pre-qualification they will just accept what the buyer tells them.`

                body: `The answer to this question really depends on the circumstances. The purpose of continuing to show your home is to try to elicit a back-up offer that can be immediately enacted if the original sales contract falls through. If you arenât living in the home there is likely not a downside to having it shown. However, if you are still living there, these showings may continue to disrupt your life. Talk to your agent about whether they recommend this in your circumstances. If it is imperative you sell quickly, it might be worth the aggravation to continue to allow your home to be shown. It may also be a good idea if you have reason to believe that your buyers may have difficulty obtaining loan approval or if you have concern that the buyers may back out after the inspection.`

The reason you want to go with someone local is that you can count on better customer service because that lender gets their business from word-of-mouth not from advertising. If they donât provide excellent service they will not be getting more business and they know that. The reason you may not necessarily want to go with the local bank where you keep your accounts is two-fold. First, the customer service representative at your local bank very likely does not deal in mortgages and the person they refer you to (especially with larger banks) may not be local. But also, by going directly to a bank you will not have the same number of mortgage options to choose from and may miss out on a product that would be great for you. By contrast, a good mortgage broker will work with many banks and private money lenders, and therefore will be able to offer you more alternatives. Ask your REALTORÂ® to give you some names of local lenders they recommend.`

There are contingences within the sales contract that will allow the buyer to get their money back in certain instances (for example, they change their mind in the inspection period or they get denied the loan). However, the seller will want assurance that the buyer will not back out of the deal for no reason at the last minute. If that were to happen, the seller may be entitled to keep the deposit. Typically, the seller will expect a deposit equal to around 1% of the purchase price.`
